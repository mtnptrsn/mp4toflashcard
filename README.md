# mp4toflashcard

This script converts an MP4 file into a set of flashcards in CSV format. It extracts audio from the MP4 file, transcribes it using the Whisper model, and then uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate flashcards from the transcribed text.

#### Example

Using this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM (React in 100 Seconds by Fireship) generates this output:
